## A* pathfinding algorithm

This algorithm solves a maze from a given file.

To run the algorithm, compile `main.cpp` and then run

`./program.exe <input-filename> <output-filename>`

where the input filename needs to be a rectangle of charactes in the following format:

`-` if the location is an empty block;

`#` if it's a wall;

`T` if it's the target block;

`S` if it's the starting block.

(see given example `grid` file)
